# Azure Text Analytics

This [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package provides command line tools
that utilise pre-built models from [Azure Text
Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics).
Individual command line tools are packaged for common text analytics
tasks including language identification, sentiment analysis, and
phrase/entity extraction. The package also provides an interactive
demonstration as an overview of the capabilities of the service. This
package is part of the [Azure on
MLHub](https://github.com/Azure/mlhub) repository.

Language identification supports many languages whilst key-phrases,
sentiment, and entities are limited to a few languages.

Text analytics is used in many scenarios, including the analysis of
customer calls into a call centre, the analysis of survey results,
monitoring social media commentary on a subject, etc.

A free Azure subscription allowing up to 5,000 transactions per month
is available from <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>. After
subscribing visit <https://ms.portal.azure.com> and Create a resource
under AI and Machine Learning called Text Analytics. Once created you
can access the web API subscription key from the portal. This will be
prompted for when running a command, and then saved to file to reduce
the need for repeated authentication requests.

Please note that these Azure models, unlike the MLHub models in
general, use *closed source services* which have no guarantee of
ongoing availability and do not come with the freedom to modify and
share.

Visit the github repository for more details:
<https://github.com/gjwgit/aztext>

The Python code is based on the [Azure Text Analytics
Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/quickstarts/python)

## Command Line Tools

This package supports the following command line tools: supported,
analyze, language, sentiment, phrases, entities. The *supported*
command lists what functionality is supported for each language. The
*analyze* commands performs a basic analysis across the four
capabilities with the other commands dealing with each of the four
capabilities.

**Supported Languages**

The *supported* command is used to check the functionality
supported for the languages that are supported by the model. The
output is the full language name, the language code, and whether
sentiment, phrases, and entity are supported.

```console
$ ml supported aztext
Arabic,ar,False,False,True
Czech,cs,False,False,True
Chinese-Simplified,zh-hans,True,False,True
Chinese-Traditional,zh-hant,True,False,False
Danish,da,True,True,True
Dutch,nl,True,True,True
English,en,True,True,True
Finnish,fi,True,True,True
French,fr,True,True,True
German,de,True,True,True
Greek,el,True,False,False
Hungarian,hu,False,False,True
Italian,it,True,True,True
Japanese,ja,True,True,True
Korean,ko,False,True,True
Norwegian  (Bokmål),no,True,True,True
Polish,pl,True,True,True
Portuguese (Portugal),pt-PT,True,True,True
Portuguese (Brazil),pt-BR,False,True,True
Russian,ru,True,True,True
Spanish,es,True,True,True
Swedish,sv,True,True,True
Turkish,tr,True,False,True
```

To check if a specific language is supported:

```console
$ ml supported aztext en
English,en,True,True,True

$ ml supported aztext id
```

Use the `--header` command line option to list the header row which
names the columns:

```console
$ ml supported aztext --header en
language,code,sentiment,phrases,entity
English,en,True,True,True
```

**Text Analysis**

The *analyze* command takes a single sentence and returns the text
analysis of the sentence, beginning with the confidence of the
identification of the language, the language code, the sentiment (0 to
1 as negative to positive), the key phrases identified separated by
colons, and the identified entities also separated by colons.

```console
$ ml analyze aztext I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and staff helpful.
1.0,en,0.96,wonderful experience:rooms:staff helpful,

$ ml analyze aztext I had a wonderful trip to Singapore and enjoyed seeing the Gardens by the Bay
1.0,en,0.96,Singapore:Gardens:wonderful trip:Bay,Location=Singapore:Location=Gardens by the Bay:Location=Bay

$ ml analyze aztext Los caminos que llevan hasta Monte Rainier son espectaculares y
1.0,es,0.55,Monte Rainier:caminos,Location=Monte Rainier

$ ml analyze aztext La carretera estaba atascada. Había mucho tráfico el día de ayer.
1.0,es,0.33,carretera:tráfico:día,

$ ml analyze aztext  这是一个用中文写的文件
1.0,zh_chs,0.75,,

$ ml analyze aztext Aku isa mangan beling tanpa lara.
1.0,id,,,

$ ml analyze aztext Các bãi biển trên Phú Quốc là tuyệt vời.
1.0,vi,,,

$ ml analyze aztext คราวนี้มีนักท่องเที่ยวจำนวนมากเกินไปที่ภูเก็ตและเราต้องต่อสู้เพื่อวางบนพื้นทราย
1.0,th,,,

$ ml analyze aztext मैं काँच खा सकता हूँ और मुझे उससे कोई चोट नहीं पहुंचती.
1.0,hi,,,
```

Note that sentiments, key phrases, and entities are not supported for
all languages. Refer to the *supported* command.

The *analyze* command will also work without an argument whereby it
will read text from standard input if it is part of a pipeline.

```console
$ cat sample.txt
They’re annoying the hell out of people.
Pour le logiciel libre, la liberté a un prix et un modèle économique
I just toured Ecuador and Peru and came back addicted to plantains.

$ cat sample.txt | ml analyze aztext
1.0,en,0.06,hell:people,
1.0,fr,1.00,liberté:prix:logiciel libre:modèle économique,DateTime=a un:Quantity=et un
1.0,en,0.70,Peru:toured Ecuador:plantains,Location=Ecuador:Location=Peru
```

If the *analyze* command is not part of a pipeline then it will enter
an interactive loop, prompting for a sentence, and analyzing that
sentence.

```console
$ ml analyze aztext
Enter text to be analysed. Quit with Empty or Ctrl-d.
(Output: conf,lang,sentiment,phrases,entities):

> La primera vez que escucho semejante palabra
1.0,es,0.52,semejante palabra,Quantity=primera
> I am pleased to return to this country Australia and to live in Melbourne
1.0,en,0.87,country Australia:Melbourne,Other=I Am (Killing Heidi song):Location=Australia:Location=Melbourne
>
```

**Named Entity Recognition**

The *entities* command identifies the entities from the text together
with other information, including the type of entity and a Wikipedia
link. For each entity identified the output consists of a single line
reporting the entity name, the type of entity and sub-type, the
confidence of the type of entity, the offset to the entity in the
original text, then text length of the entity, the Wikipedia
confidence, language, entity name, and URL.

```console
$ ml entities aztext I had a wonderful trip to Seattle last week and even visited the Space Needle 2 times!
Seattle,Location,,0.82,26,7,0.24,en,Seattle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle
last week,DateTime,DateRange,0.80,34,9,,,,
Space Needle,Location,,0.80,65,12,0.39,en,Space Needle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle
Space Needle,Organization,,0.94,65,12,,,,
2,Quantity,Number,0.80,78,1,,,,
```
As part of a command line we could count the number of unique entities
in the text:
```console
$ ml entities aztext I had a wonderful trip to Seattle last week and even visited the Space Needle 2 times! |
  cut -d, -f1 |
  sort -u |
  wc -l
4
```

How many unique locations are identified in the text:
```console
$ ml entities aztext I had a wonderful trip to Seattle last week and even visited the Space Needle 2 times! |
  awk -F, '$2=="Location"{print}' |
  cut -d, -f1 |
  sort -u |
  wc -l
2
```

**Key Phrase Extraction**

The *phrase* command extracts the key phrases from the supplied text.


**Text Sentiment Analysis**

The *sentiment* command determines how positive the text is on a scale
from 0 (negative) through 0.5 (neutral) to 1 (positive).

```console
$ ml sentiment aztext The weather here is cold and dreary
0.17

$ ml sentiment aztext had a great trip and all went really well
0.97
```

**Linked Entities Markup**

The *links* command will return the text as is but with entities that
have Wikipedia pages marked up with HTML to link to the appropriate
page. This is particularly useful in writing web pages within which
you want to have links to Wikipedia.

```console
$ ml links aztext <<END
The Internet (interconnected networks) is the
backbone of all communications and most services used today. Home,
local and international networks provide access to resources beyond
the local desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or thing (as in the
internet of things). Most computers (including smartphones) connect
either through Ethernet (named in recognition of the nebulous aether
world out there) whereby the connection is by wire, or through WiFi
(as in HiFi but for computers) to connect wirelessly. On connecting to
the Internet a unique address, called the IP address (Internet
Protocol), is assigned to the computer.
END
```
This will generate HTML marked up text that will be rendered as:

<ul>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">The
Internet</a> (interconnected networks) is the backbone of all
communications and most services used today. <a

</ul>

# Pipeline Use Cases

**Extract Just Positive Utterances From File**

```console
$ cat sample.txt | 
  ml sentiment aztext | 
  awk '$1>0.5{print NR}' | 
  xargs -I % sed -n %p sample.txt

Pour le logiciel libre, la liberté a un prix et un modèle économique
I just toured Ecuador and Peru and came back addicted to plantains.
```

# Demonstration

```console
$ ml demo aztext 

==================== 
Azure Text Analytics
====================

Welcome to a demo of the pre-built models for Text Analytics provided
through Azure's Cognitive Services. This service extracts information
from text that we supply to it, providing information such as the
language, key phrases, sentiment (0-1 as negative to positive), and
entities.

The following file has been found and is assumed to contain
an Azure Text Analytics subscription key and region. We will load 
the file and use this information.

/home/gjw/.mlhub/aztext/private.py

Press Enter to continue: 

====================
Language Information
====================

We will first demonstrate the automated identification of language. Below
are a few "documents" in different languages which are passed on to the 
cloud for processing using the following language API URL:

https://southeastasia.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/languages

Press Enter to continue: 

1 This line is some text as a sample document written in English.
  This is English (en) with score of 1.0.

2 Este es un document escrito en Español.
  This is Spanish (es) with score of 1.0.

3 这是一个用中文写的文件
  This is Chinese_Simplified (zh_chs) with score of 1.0.

4 Nor for itself hath any care.
  This is English (en) with score of 1.0.

5 Nor for itself es un escrito 这是.
  This is Spanish (es) with score of 0.75.
  NOTE: the text is rather jumbled hence a lower score.

6 Τη γλώσσα μου έδωσαν ελληνική
  This is Greek (el) with score of 1.0.

7 मैं काँच खा सकता हूँ और मुझे उससे कोई चोट नहीं पहुंचती.
  This is Hindi (hi) with score of 1.0.

8 Aku isa mangan beling tanpa lara.
  This is Indonesian (id) with score of 1.0.
  NOTE: a little tricky as it is actually Javanese.

9 ฉันกินกระจกได้ แต่มันไม่ทำให้ฉันเจ็บ
  This is Thai (th) with score of 1.0.

10 Ich canne glas eten and hit hirtiþ me nouȝt.
  This is English (en) with score of 1.0.
  NOTE: yes it is actually Ye Olde English.

That's the end of the language identification. Press Enter to continue: 

==================
Sentiment Analysis
==================

Now we look at an analysis of the sentiment of the document/text. This is
done so by passing the text of the document on to the sentiment API URL
shown below for processing in the cloud. The results are returned as a number
between 0 and 1 with 0 being the most negative and 1 being the most positive.

https://southeastasia.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment

Press Enter to continue: 

1 I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff
  were helpful.
  This has a sentiment rating of 0.97.

2 I had a terrible time at the hotel. The staff was rude and the food
  was awful.
  This has a sentiment rating of 0.00.

3 Los caminos que llevan hasta Monte Rainier son espectaculares y
  hermosos.
  This has a sentiment rating of 0.75.

4 La carretera estaba atascada. Había mucho tráfico el día de ayer.
  This has a sentiment rating of 0.33.

That's the end of the sentiment examples. Press Enter to continue: 

===========
Key Phrases
===========

We are often interested, for further analysis, in the key phrases of a 
document. Here we extract what are considered to be the key phrases of
the document. Again, the text is passed on to the cloud through the API
at the URL below.

https://southeastasia.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/keyPhrases

Press Enter to continue: 

1 I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and staff
  helpful.
  The key phrases here are: ['wonderful experience', 'rooms', 'staff helpful'].

2 I had a terrible time at the hotel. The staff was rude and the food
  was awful.
  The key phrases here are: ['food', 'terrible time', 'hotel', 'staff'].

3 Los caminos que llevan hasta Monte Rainier son espectaculares y
  hermosos.
  The key phrases here are: ['Monte Rainier', 'caminos'].

4 La carretera estaba atascada. Había mucho tráfico el día de ayer.
  The key phrases here are: ['carretera', 'tráfico', 'día'].

That's the end of the key phrases. Press Enter to continue: 

========
Entities
========

Our final demonstration identifies the entities refered to in the document.
As a bonus the API generates a link to Wikipedia for more information! As 
above, the text is passed on to the cloud through the API at the URL below.
